 Imputation for missing data
 Rapid prototyping and scripting languages
 Causal inference
 Basic probability
 Correlation vs Causation
 Observational vs RCT
 Scientific method - Medicine
 Significance testing











### processing data

missing variale issue

### rapid prototyping

### scripting language

python

## characterising learning

### probability

#### independent and dependent

- independent

  the outcome of one even dont effect the outcome of others

- dependent

  above



### correlation vs causality

- correlation

  a statical relationship btw random and bivariate

- Causality



- causal learning

  

- causal inference



### Observation studies

oberservation

Cohort

case control



## Randomised control trais

Aim to redue bias

### Main types

- paralle
- crossover
- cluster
- factorial

### Disadvantage and advantage

- disadvantage
  - expensive
  - Slow  labout intensive
  - not ethical

- advantage
  - eliminate bias
  - blinding participants
  - apply probability theory



## Ethically of RCT's



## Hypothesis

## significance testing primer

## erro

## Pharmacovigilance

## Drug Interactions

### False Positive rates

### ROC curve

the curve plot the false positive and true positive

the best classficaiton has the largest area under curve
